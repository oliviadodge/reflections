What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It adds a .git directory to the folder. You need to do this because you need that metadata contained in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place where you can add files you think you might want to commit. It's like preparing your package for commitment. Almost like a counter where you put all ingredients for a recipe before combining them.
